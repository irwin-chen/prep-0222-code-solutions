          Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which could only be
          broken by Love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire breathing dragon. Many brave
          knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.
